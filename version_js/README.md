# Prim

This is a graphic version of the game made
in ``version_c`` using `electron` instead
of ``ncurses``.

Current version : ``3.0.x``

## How to compile or run

You need

* ``node.js``
* ``npm``

in order to run this. After they are installed,
simply run

* ``npm install``
* ``npm start``

to start the program.

If you want to edit the typescript files, you need
to compile then again. You can do it with
``npx tsc`` or maybe with ``tsc``.
