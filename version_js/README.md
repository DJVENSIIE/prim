# Prim

This is a graphic version of the game made
in ``version_c`` using `electron` instead
of ``ncurses``.

### How to compile or run

You need ``node.js`` and ``npm``
in order to run this. After they are installed,
simply run ``npm install`` then ``npm start``.
to start the program.

If you want to edit the typescript files, you need
to compile then again. You can do it with
``npx tsc`` or maybe with ``tsc``.
