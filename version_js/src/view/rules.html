                    While the students from the "Calcul intensif et
                    donn√©es massives" cursus
                    of ENSIIE were exploring the binary world, they have opened a gate between
                    our world and another one looking exactly like ours
                    However, their joy didn't last long. Having 2 ENSIIE made their
                    ranking in durable development decrease because their were spending twice
                    their usual consommation of energy. That's why

                    You will have to spend <span class="text-my-yellow">energy (E)</span>
                    to buy machines while preventing your
                    <span class="text-my-yellow">durable development (DD)</span>
                    from reaching <span class="text-my-red">0</span> (meaning the destruction

                    <br>
                    Your goal will be to produce
                    and send to the gate <span class="text-my-yellow" id="game-goal">10000</span>
                    resources in order to close it. Beware ! Each resource send will produce
                    a garbage that you will have to handle otherwise your DD will decrease by
                    <span class="text-my-yellow" id="game-dd-malus">1</span>.

                <p id="tr-rules-play" class="text-white">

                    At the start, you will have <span class="text-my-yellow">
                    <span id="game-nb-sources">2</span> sources</span> that produces <span class="text-my-yellow">
                    <span id="game-production">3</span> resources/<span id="game-turns-prod">10</span> turns</span>.

                    You will have to buy a machine called a <span class="text-my-yellow">collector</span>
                    to mine resources from a source (or garbage from the door) then send them
                    using either a <span class="text-my-yellow">conveyor belt</span>
                    or a <span class="text-my-yellow">cross belt</span> to the gate.
                    <br>

                    You can send garbage to a <span class="text-my-yellow">recycling center</span>
                    or in a <span class="text-my-yellow">junkyard</span> according to your strategy.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    But in order to buy a machine, you will need <span class="text-my-yellow">E</span>
                    and <span class="text-my-yellow">DD</span> ! These are produced by the student of
                    the ENSIIE, called FISE (initial training course, <span class="text-my-yellow">
                    <span id="game-fise-e">1</span>E <span id="game-fise-dd">1</span>DD</span>
                    per turn) or FISA (part-time training course, <span class="text-my-yellow">
                    <span id="game-fisa-e">4</span>E</span> or <span class="text-my-yellow">
                    <span id="game-fisa-dd">4</span>
                    DD</span> per <span class="text-my-yellow" id="game-fisa-turn">2</span> turns).
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    If you have enough <span class="text-my-yellow">E</span>
                    and <span class="text-my-yellow">DD</span>, you can hire a Staff that can reduce
                    the cost of a machine, hire a lot of students, ...
