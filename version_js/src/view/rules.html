            While the students from the "Calcul intensif et donn√©es massives" cursus
            of ENSIIE were exploring the binary world, they have opened a gate between
            our world and another one looking exactly like ours.
            <br/>
            However, their joy didn't last long. Having 2 ENSIIE made their
            ranking in durable development decrease because their were spending twice
            their usual consommation of energy. That's why
            <span class="text-success">you absolutely need to close the door !</span>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="text-justify px-3 border-dark border my-3">
        <p class="text-center h3 pt-3">What are the rules ?</p>
        <p class="fz22">
            You will have to spend <span class="text-success">energy (E)</span>
            to buy machines while preventing your
            <span class="text-success">durable development (DD)</span>
            from reaching <span class="text-danger">0</span> (meaning the destruction
            of your world).
            <br>
            Your goal will be to produce
            and send to the gate <span class="text-success" id="game-goal">10 000</span>
            resources in order to close it. Beware ! Each resource send will produce
            a garbage that you will have to handle otherwise your DD will decrease by
            <span class="text-success" id="game-dd-malus">1</span>.

    </div>

    <div class="text-justify px-3 border-dark border my-3">
        <p class="text-center h3 pt-3">How should I play ?</p>
        <p class="fz22">
            At the start, you will have <span class="text-success">
            <span id="game-nb-sources">2</span> sources</span>
            that produces <span class="text-success">
            <span id="game-production">3</span>
            resources/<span id="game-turns-prod">10</span> turns</span>.
            You will have to buy a machine called a <span class="text-success">collector</span>
            to mine resources from a source (or garbage from the door) then send them
            using either a <span class="text-success">conveyor belt</span>
            or a <span class="text-success">cross belt</span>.
            <br>
            You can send garbage to a <span class="text-success">recycling center</span>
            or in a <span class="text-success">junkyard</span> according to your strategy.
            <i class="text-muted small">You
            will have a guide in-game to see more information about each machine.</i>
            <br>
            <br>
            But in order to buy a machine, you will need <span class="text-success">E</span>
            and <span class="text-success">DD</span> ! These are produced by the student of
            the ENSIIE, called FISE (initial training course, <span class="text-success">
            <span id="game-fise-e">1</span>E+<span id="game-fise-dd">1</span>DD
            </span>
            per turn) or FISA (part-time training course, <span class="text-success">
            <span id="game-fisa-e">4</span>E</span> or <span class="text-success">
            <span id="game-fisa-dd">4</span>
            DD</span> per
            <span class="text-success" id="game-fisa-turn">2</span>
            turns).
            <br>
            <br>
            If you have enough <span class="text-success">E</span>
            and <span class="text-success">DD</span>, you can hire a Staff that can reduce
            the cost of a machine, hire a lot of students, ...
